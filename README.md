## Dataset 1

MovieLens 100K Dataset

http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip


* Now that we downloaded into our Hadoop cluster we use Hive to actually execute SQL queries on top of that data, even though it's not really being stored in the relational database and could be a distributed manner across an entire cluster.
* u.data file represents our tab limited data: uid\t movie_id\t rating\t timestamp
* u.item file has information about the data rows. Mappings from movie id to movie name, release date and genre
